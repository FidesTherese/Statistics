## What is this?

This repository provides highly accurate and more robust statistical computation than usual statistical tools. For example, the t-test module in the repository will automatically select the best algorithm according to the data provided, and it allows users to choose more robust method such as Yuen-Welch's t-test.

## Purpose

Although R is good open-source tool that provides accurate and robust statistical computation, Python is more popular than R. For those who change their works from R to Python, this repository offers more smooth transition.
